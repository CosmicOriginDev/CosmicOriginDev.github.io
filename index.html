        <p>When I was four, I watched my mother play video games. She became a hero fighting monsters or an astronaut shooting aliens. I felt like I was actually there, alongside my mother in her epic quests. The fact that these universes are made by people and fit inside a cartridge captivated me. I dreamed endlessly of the video games I could create. When I was seven, my father bought me a book on how to code video games. After I typed the programs from the book, I realized I could develop my own games just like the ones I dreamed about.</p>
