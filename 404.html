You only know one thing: Your ship and passengers are in danger, and only you can rescue them. Can you make the perilous journey back to your ship before it's too late? Space Grapple is a project I made in 2020. It is a puzzle game where you use a grapple gun to fling yourself around the stage into the exit portal. </p></project><project ngh="0"><h1> Draggles </h1><h2>  -  </h2><p> Meet Draggles, your new destructive companion! Draggles is the perfect pet for anyone who wishes to wield massive destructive powers! Draggles can follow commands via the Dragon Tablet, or be piloted like a mech. Draggles is my second mod for the game Teardown. I never thought it would do as well as Evil Plant. Little did I know what was in store... </p></project><project ngh="0"><h1> Evil Plant </h1><h2>  -  </h2><p> Ready your rocket launcher and whip out the flamethrower because a weed whacker won't cut it! This was my first mod for the game Teardown. I remember posting it to Steam Workshop and watching the views and downloads go up and up. I could not believe my eyes. </p></project></html></app-root>
