# Notes:
# - This workflow replaces any Jekyll-based build step. It builds the Angular app using npm and ensures the artifact root contains a .nojekyll file so Pages will not run Jekyll.
# - If your Angular CLI outputs to a different directory, adjust the build command or the paths accordingly.
# - The job triggers on pushes to the main branch. Update the trigger if you deploy from a different branch.
